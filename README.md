# INTRODUCTION
----------------
   The purpose of this class is  for the students to learn how to make a game from scratch. All the graphic designs, codes, sounds, backgrounds, etc were made by students. If any were pulled off from other sources, they were still modified by the students before being used. The game me and my team worked on was called "Tower Escape." The idea behind the game is how the player escapes an office which is caught on fire.  As the name tells, it is indeed a maze game.
   
   The game was kept simple and easy. Point of the game is for all levels of players to be able to play it and have fun. It is a one player game. The playing keys are simple; UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrows for movement. The main function for the player is to get through all the levels as fast as possible without dying more than three times. The key to open the doors is placed at random places throughout the office. The player faces obstacles as the levels get higher and more complicated.  Running into the burning fire and getting hit by staplers are two of the main ones. Each level has 3 keys to collect in order to get to the door and side equipment to save you from the danger. Once you've gotten all three keys and have made it out  through the obstacles, you are good to pass through the exit door.

# EXPERIENCE
-------------
  When I first came into this class, I did not know what to expect. Little did I know that I was actually going to be working with teams on game development. I did not have much programming or game designing experience at all. Our professor did give us a few game designing and programming  assignments prior to the actual game we had to make. Those assignments definitely gave me the head start I needed for game making, but unfortunately they did not teach me everything I needed to know to make the game to the best of my ability. That is where the team work pitched in. I learned a lot from each one of them, as they were students who were half way into programming and it was just the beginning for me. I learned tips of coding here and there, learned a lot about modifying graphics, and learned how to deal with sound effects. Over all, I learned very much about game maker in general! It was definitely a good start to my computer science learning journey.
